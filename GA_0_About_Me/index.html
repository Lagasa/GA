	<h1>Cards for My Friends</h1>
	<h2>I like to mail notes to my friends. Ideally, something handmade -although that's not always possible. I like picturing these cards passing through vast machines and long beltways, going from bins, to boxes, to bags... in airplanes, trucks, trains or beat up vans, to the hands of a mailman or mailwoman and arriving in my friends doorway.
